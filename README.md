# Tatur â€” an assistant in acquaintance
------------
This bot was created as a part of test tasks from Yandex Practicum.

It has a simple menu and a communication system that will help you get to know the author.
For example, you can read a small story about my main hobby, listen some voice messages with explanation of different things, request the link to source code and use speech (voice messages) for that commands.

Since the internal structure is quite simple, you can explore it yourself by cloning the repository and running the bot.
